# Privacy-Preserving Diabetes Classification with Federated Learning

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook implementation of a privacy-preserving diabetes classification system using Federated Learning. This project was presented at the 4th BİLSEL International TRUVA Scientific Research Congress in Çanakkale, Turkey.

**Key Features:**

* **Federated Learning:** Preserves data privacy by training a model on decentralized data.
* **Centralized Learning:** Traditional machine learning approach for comparison.
* **Diabetes Classification:** Accurate prediction of diabetes risk.

**To Run the Notebook:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name]
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. **Run the notebook:** Open **Gestational Diabetes Classification.ipynb** or **Gestational Diabetes Classification using Federated Learning.ipynb** or **Pima Indians Diabetes Database Federated.ipynb** in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
